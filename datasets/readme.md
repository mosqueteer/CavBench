# Download CavBench datasets

The datasets come in two formats, csv and xml. The former is more compact than the latter. 
These files are large, so they have to be downloaded from figshare repository:

[CavBench's datasets](https://figshare.com/articles/CavBench_datasets/9917087)

and must be uncompressed within the folder <code>CavBench/datasets/</code>
