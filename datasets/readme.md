# Download CavBench datasets

The datasets come in two formats, csv and xml. The former is more compact than the latter. 
These files are large (about 10GB), so they have to be downloaded from:

[CavBench's datasets](https://figshare.com/authors/Abel_Gomes/7440581)

and must be uncompressed within the folder <code>CavBench/datasets/</code>
