# CavBench
This is a generic and extensible benchmark to compare different protein cavity detection methods relative to diverse ground truth datasets. It makes it possible to compare any two or more protein cavity detection methods against a ground-truth using statistical classification metrics including precision, recall and F-score. CavBench was also designed to be extensible, i.e., to make it possible to add new binding-site datasets in order to assess novel  cavity detection methods. Indeed, CavBench does not require running new cavity detection programs directly, rather it only requires the datasets generated by these methods, using a common format. Moreover, CavBench is platform-independent since it runs on all major operating systems, namely Mac OSX, Unix/Linux, and Windows.
# How to run?
In the shell command line, just type:

<font face="Courier New">$ CavBench</font>

         <td class="content">
            <span class="css-truncate css-truncate-target"><a class="js-navigation-open" title="inputTTHints.py" id="c6963efd9f18c234cef6269c58221798-f8d10b5679fb77c99760f7d0fb6bb0ae985d2e12" href="/adobe-type-tools/fontlab-scripts/blob/master/TrueType/inputTTHints.py">inputTTHints.py</a></span>
          </td>
 
But, before that, please make sure that the file CavBench.sh has the due permissions 'x' to execute. To check this out, type the following in the command line:

$ ls -la 

to see the execution permissions. 

If necessary to add execution permissions, please type:

$ chmod +x CavBench.sh
